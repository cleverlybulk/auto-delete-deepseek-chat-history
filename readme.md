# Introduction
since i was using deepseek with a junk account i thought about the following scenarion :

> so deleting chat history is a good idea 
# How to use 
1- copy script.js 
2- open the console of the browser using F12 or click anywhere on the page and click on inspect element then chose the console tab 
3- write in the console 
```
allow pasting
```
since the console doesn't allow pasting by default 
4- past the script into the console and hit enter 
5- watch the magic !
